# Solutions to Exercise 2.5 (Identify and correct the errors)

## a)

- The semicolon after the if statement makes the if statement's body run anyway, regardless of the condition.

```cpp
// Correct code
if (c < 7) { // Removed the semicolon
    cout << "c is less than 7\n";
}
```

## b)

- The greater than or equal operator is written as `=>` not as `>=`.

```cpp
// Correct code
if (c >= 7) { // Changed the operator to >=
    cout << "c is equal to or greater than 7\n";
}
```
