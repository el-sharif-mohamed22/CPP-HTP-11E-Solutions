# Solution to Exercise 2.9 (State the order of evaluation of the operators):

## a)
```cpp
x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1; // 3 * 6 evaluated first
x = 7 + 18 / 2 - 1; // 18 / 2 evaluated second
x = 7 + 9 - 1; // 7 + 9 evaluated third
x = 16 - 1; // 16 - 1 evaluated fourth
x = 15; // assignment of 15 to x evaluated fifth
15;
```

## b)
```cpp
x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2; // 2 % 2 evaluated first
x = 0 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2; // 2 * 2 evaluated second
x = 0 + 4 - 2 / 2; // 2 / 2 evaluated third
x = 0 + 4 - 1; // 0 + 4 evaluated fourth
x = 4 - 1; // 4 - 1 evaluated fifth
x = 3; // assignment of 3 to x evaluated sixth
3;
```

## c)
```cpp
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / (3)))); // (3) evaluated first
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / 3))); // 9 * 3 in the innermost parentheses evaluated third
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (27 / 3))); // 18 / 3 in the innermost parentheses evaluated fourth
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9))); // (9) is evaluated fifth
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + 9)); // 3 + 9 evaluated sixth
x = (3 * 9 * 12); // 3 * 9 evaluated seventh
x = (27 * 12); // 27 * 12 evaluated eighth
x = 324; // assignment of 324 to x evaluated ninth
324;
```
