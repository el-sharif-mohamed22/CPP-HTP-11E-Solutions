# Exercise 2.9: State the order of evaluation of the operators

- a) 
```cpp
x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1;
x = 7 + 12 / 2 - 1;         // 3 * 6  is evaluated giving 12
x = 7 + 6 - 1;              // 12 / 2 is evaluated giving 6
x = 13 - 1;                 // 7 + 6  is evaluated giving 13
x = 12;                     // 13 - 1 is evaluated giving 12 
```

- b)
```cpp
x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2;
x = 0 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2;      // 2 % 2 is evaulated giving 0
x = 0 + 4 - 2 / 2;          // 2 * 2 is evaulated giving 4
x = 0 + 4 - 1;              // 2 / 2 is evaulated giving 1
x = 4 - 1;                  // 0 + 4 is evaulated giving 4                  
x = 3;                      // 4 - 1 is evaulated giving 3
```

- c)
```cpp
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / (3))));      
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / 3)));        // (3) gets evaluated
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (27 / 3)));           // 9 * 3  is evaluated giving 27
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9)));                // 27 / 3 is evaluated giving 9
x = (3 * 9 * (3 + 9));                  // (9) gets evaluated
x = (3 * 9 * (12));                     // 3 + 9  is evaluated giving 12
x = (3 * 9 * 12);                       // (12) is evaluated
x = (3 * 9 * 12);                       // 3 * 9  is evalauted giving 27
x = (27 * 12);                          // 27 * 12 is evaluated giving 324
```
