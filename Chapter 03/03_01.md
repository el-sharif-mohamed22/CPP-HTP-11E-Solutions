# Solutions to Exercise 3.1 (Correct the Code Errors)

## a)

- **_Syntax error_** because of putting a semicolon after the `if` statement.
- This leads that the `else` statement doesn't find a previous if statement.
```c++
if (age >= 65) { // removed the semicolon
    cout << "Age is greater than or equal to 65\n";
}
else {
    cout << "Age is less than 65\n";
}
```

## b)
- **_Logic error_** that leads to (infinite loop).
- Because of not using braces for the `while` loop body, that leads that only
the first statement after the `while` loop is considered as the loop body.
- And `x` is never incremented, so the loop will never end.

```c++
while (x <= 10) { // added opening brace
    total += x;
    ++x;
} // added closing brace
```

## c)
- **_Logic error_** that leads to (infinite loop).
- The `while` loop body doesn't have any statement that makes the condition `false`.
- `y` is always incremented and it's always ` > 0`, so the loop will never end.

```c++
while (y > 0) {
    cout << y << "\n";
    --y; // changed preincrement to predecrement
    // this way numbers from 10 to 1 will be printed
}
```
