# Exercise 3.1: Correct the Code Errors

- a) `;` after the if statement's condition will not execute the if statement.
```cpp
if (age >= 65) {
    cout << "Age is greater than or equal to 65\n";
} else {
    cout << "Age is less than 65\n";
}
```
- b) since the while statement doesn't have a curly bracket, only the first statement after that is included inside the loop, whereas the pre-increment operator is not included. Which will result in an infinte loop
```cpp
int x{1};
int total;

while (x <= 10) {
    total += x;
    ++x;
}
```
- c) The `y` variable is incrementing instead of decrementing, which will end in an infinte loop.
```cpp
int y{10};
while (y > 0) {
    cout << y << "\n";
    --y;
}
```
