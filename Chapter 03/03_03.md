# Solutions to Exercise 3.3 (Gas Mileage)

## Pseudocode

```txt
Calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each trip, and 
print the combined miles per gallon obtained for all tankfuls up to this point.
```

## First Refinement

```txt
initialize variables
input each trip until quit, print MPG for this trip and total MPG up to this point.
```

## Second Refinement

```txt
initialize total miles to zero
initialize total gallons to zero

prompt user to enter trip miles
input trip miles 

while trip miles not sentinel:
    prompt user to enter trip gallons
    input trip gallons

    print MPG for this trip

    add trip miles to total miles
    add trip gallons to total gallons
    print total MPG until this point
```
