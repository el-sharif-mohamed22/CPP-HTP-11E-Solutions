# Exercise 3.22

There are two things that the programmer might want to do, that is:

* maybe he wanted to pre increment both `x` and `y` and then add it together, `(x + y)`.

```cpp
cout << ++x + ++y;
```

* or he might have wanted to increment to 1 after adding `x` and `y`.

```cpp
cout << (x + y) = 1;
```
