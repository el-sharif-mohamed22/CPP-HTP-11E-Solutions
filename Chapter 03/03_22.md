# Solutions to Exercise 3.22 (What's wrong with the following statement?)

- The problem is that there is a **_compilation error_** because using increment operator on an expression other than one to which a value can be assigned `(x + y)` cannot be assigned a value.

```cpp
// Probable fix is that programmer wanted to add one to (x + y).
// So, the correct statement should be:
cout << (x + y) + 1;

// Or, maybe he wanted to increment both x and y by one then add them.
// So, the correct statement should be:
cout << ++x + ++y;

```
